# Problem_Solving

These are the problems sets that I solved in the course:
MIT - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

1) `find_vowels_in_string.py` - Finding number of vowels in a any string.

2) `find_word_occurrence_in_string.py` - Finding the occurrence of string `bob` in any string.

3) `longest_substring_alphabetical_order.py` - Program to print the longest substring in any string.

4) `guess_number.py` - Computer will guess the secret number of the user from 0 to 100.

5) `iter_power.py` - Iterative function that calculates the exponential base by using successive multiplication.

6) `power_recur.py` - Function which computes base by recursively calling itself and then multiplying the result.

7) `gcd_iter.py` - Iterative function for greatest common divisor of 2 positive integers.

8) `gcd_recur.py` - Recursive function for greatest common divisor of 2 positive integers.

9) `bisection_search_character_in_string.py` - Using bisection search, determine if a character is in a string as long as the string  is sorted in alphabetical order.

10) `paying_debt_off_in_a_year.py` - A program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

11) `bisection_search_fixed_monthly_payment.py` - A program to calculate more accurate fixed monthly payment.

12) `dict_biggest.py` - Using dictionaries, a procedure that returns the key corresponding to the entry with the largest number of values associated with it.

13) `MIT_hangman_game.py` - A variation of the classic wordgame Hangman. Interactive hangman game between a player and the computer.
